I am Eduard Saakashvili, an AI researcher based in Utrecht. My interests lie at the intersection of data science and the humanities. On this page, I post essays, book reviews, technical projects, and other content related to my interests.

I got my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Utrecht University. Before that, I worked in journalism and content production for organizations including NPR, Coda Story, Blinkist, and the Hertie School of Governance, writing [articles](https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/make-truth-great-again/) and making [podcasts](https://whyy.org/segments/who-owns-the-moon/). 

I attended Swarthmore College, where I majored in Film and Media Studies.

I sometimes post to my [Substack newsletter](https://eduard.substack.com/) when I have a specific project going on there. My last newsletter project was a March 2020 attempt to theorize the early days of the pandemic.
